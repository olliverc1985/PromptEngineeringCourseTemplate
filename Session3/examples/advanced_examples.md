## 2. Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting

### Example: Problem-Solving Scenario
```
Context: Solving a complex business problem
Task: Use Chain of Thought to determine the best approach for automating a customer service process.

Let's think about this step by step:

1. First, let's identify current manual processes:
   - List all customer service tasks
   - Categorise by complexity
   - Note time requirements

2. Then, analyse automation potential:
   - Evaluate technical feasibility
   - Consider cost implications
   - Assess impact on customer experience

3. Finally, prioritise implementation:
   - Rank by impact vs effort
   - Consider dependencies
   - Create timeline

Conclusion: Based on this analysis...
```

## 3. Self-Reflection Mechanisms

### Example: Content Quality Assessment
```
Task: Generate and self-evaluate a marketing email.

Step 1: Initial Draft
{Generate marketing email content}

Step 2: Self-Reflection Questions
- Does this content align with brand voice?
- Is the message clear and compelling?
- Are all key points included?
- Is the call-to-action strong?

Step 3: Improvements
{Based on reflection, suggest specific improvements}

Step 4: Final Version
{Present improved version with explanations of changes}
```

## 4. Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Multi-Step Problem Solving
```
Complex Task: Develop a new product launch strategy

Step 1: Market Analysis Prompt
"Analyse the current market conditions for [product type], considering:
- Target audience
- Competitor landscape
- Market gaps
Please think through each aspect systematically."

Step 2: Strategy Development Prompt
"Based on the market analysis, develop a launch strategy that:
- Addresses identified gaps
- Differentiates from competitors
- Appeals to target audience
Walk through your reasoning for each decision."

Step 3: Implementation Planning Prompt
"Create a detailed implementation plan that:
- Breaks down tasks
- Sets timelines
- Allocates resources
Explain the logic behind each element."
```

### Exercise 2: Self-Improving Prompts
```
Initial Prompt:
"Write a customer service response about a delayed delivery."

Self-Improvement Layer:
"After generating the response, evaluate it based on:
1. Empathy level
2. Solution clarity
3. Professional tone
4. Completeness of information

Then, improve any areas that score below 8/10."
```

## 5. Advanced Techniques Showcase

### Zero-Shot Prompting
```
Context: No examples provided
Task: "Generate a professional email template for client onboarding, ensuring it includes all necessary elements without any specific examples to reference."
```

### Few-Shot Prompting
```
Context: Limited examples provided
Example 1: [Brief example of successful format]
Example 2: [Brief example of successful format]
Task: "Following the pattern shown in these examples, create a new template for [specific scenario]"
```

### Self-Consistency Checking
```
Task: Generate multiple solutions and cross-validate
Prompt: "Generate three different approaches to [problem]. Then, analyse the consistency and effectiveness of each approach, identifying the strongest elements from each to create an optimal solution."
```

### Error Handling and Validation
```
Context: Processing user data input
Task: Create a robust prompt that handles various error scenarios

Step 1: Input Validation
"Before processing the [data type], verify:
- Required fields are present
- Data formats are correct
- Values are within acceptable ranges
If any checks fail, specify which validation failed and why."

Step 2: Error Response Generation
"For each validation error:
1. Create user-friendly error message
2. Provide specific correction guidance
3. Maintain audit trail of issues
4. Suggest valid alternatives"

Example Implementation:
```
Input: Process customer order
Validation Checks:
- Email format ✓
- Delivery address ✗ (Postcode missing)
- Payment details ✓
- Order quantity ✗ (Exceeds stock)

Response:
"We noticed two items that need attention:
1. Please add your postcode to complete the delivery address
2. The requested quantity (50) exceeds our stock (30). Would you like to:
   - Order the available 30 units
   - Split into multiple deliveries
   - Receive notification when stock is replenished"
```
