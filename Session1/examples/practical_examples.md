## 1. What is Prompt Engineering?

### Example 1: Definition and Importance
```
Basic Prompt: "Write a story"
Engineered Prompt: "Write a 500-word children's story about friendship, suitable for ages 6-8, featuring talking animals and a moral lesson"

This demonstrates how prompt engineering transforms vague requests into clear, specific instructions.
```

### Example 2: Role in AI Interactions
```
Basic Interaction: "Check this text"
Engineered Interaction: "Review this business proposal for:
1. Grammar and spelling
2. Professional tone
3. Logical flow
4. Clarity of key points"

This shows how proper prompting creates more useful AI interactions.
```

### Example 3: Impact on Output Quality
```
Basic Output Request: "Give me ideas for my business"
Engineered Output Request: "Suggest 5 actionable marketing strategies for a new local coffee shop, considering:
- A monthly budget of £1,000
- Target audience of young professionals
- City centre location
- Focus on sustainability"

This illustrates how detailed prompting leads to more valuable and applicable outputs.
```

## 2. Command-Based Prompts

### Example 1: Basic Command
```
Write a professional email to schedule a team meeting.
```

### Example 2: Detailed Command
```
Write a professional email to schedule a team meeting with the following details:
- Meeting duration: 1 hour
- Topic: Q2 Planning
- Suggested times: Tuesday or Wednesday next week
- Include a note about preparing quarterly reports
```

## 3. Question-Based Prompts

### Example 1: Simple Question
```
What are the key components of an effective marketing strategy?
```

### Example 2: Detailed Question
```
What are the key components of an effective marketing strategy for a small local bakery with a budget of £5,000, targeting middle-class families in a suburban area?
```

## 4. Scenario-Based Prompts

### Example 1: Basic Scenario
```
You are a customer service representative handling a complaint about a delayed delivery. Write a response to the customer.
```

### Example 2: Detailed Scenario
```
You are a customer service representative at an online clothing store. A customer has written a complaint about receiving the wrong size dress for their daughter's wedding, which is in 3 days. The correct size is currently out of stock. Write a response that addresses their concerns and offers solutions.
```

## 5. Context-Setting Prompts

### Example 1: Simple Context
```
Context: You are an HR professional.
Task: Write guidelines for conducting performance reviews.
```

### Example 2: Detailed Context
```
Context: You are an HR professional at a tech startup with 50 employees. The company has never had formal performance reviews before, and the workforce is primarily millennials and Gen Z.
Task: Write guidelines for implementing a new performance review system that focuses on growth and development rather than traditional metrics.
```

## 6. Understanding AI Interpretation

### Example 1: How AI Processes Prompts
```
Poor: Tell me about cats
Better: Describe the key characteristics and behaviours of domestic cats, including their physical features and typical pet care needs.

Why it works better: The second version provides clear parameters and specific aspects to focus on.
```

### Example 2: Common Interpretation Patterns
```
Ambiguous: Make it better
Clear: Improve this text by:
1. Correcting any grammatical errors
2. Enhancing clarity
3. Making the tone more professional
4. Maintaining the original message

Why it works better: The clear version provides specific actions and criteria for improvement.
```

### Example 3: Avoiding Ambiguity
```
Ambiguous: Write something creative about the weather
Clear: Write a 100-word description of a rainy day in London, focusing on:
- The sounds of rain on windows
- The mood of pedestrians
- The effect on city traffic

Why it works better: The clear version specifies length, subject focus, and key elements to include.
```

### Example 4: AI Interpretation Patterns
```
Task: Understanding how AI processes different types of information

1. Pattern Recognition
Poor: "Find similar items"
Better: "Identify products with similar price points, target audience, and market positioning to [specific product]"

Why it works: Provides specific comparison criteria and context

2. Contextual Understanding
Poor: "What happened in the meeting?"
Better: "Summarise the key decisions and action items from the quarterly planning meeting held on [date], focusing on budget allocation and project timelines"

Why it works: Provides specific context and focus areas

3. Numerical Processing
Poor: "Calculate the growth"
Better: "Calculate the year-over-year growth rate for Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023, expressing the result as a percentage and highlighting any significant factors affecting the change"

Why it works: Specifies calculation method and required format

4. Sequential Logic
Poor: "Fix the problem"
Better: "Analyse the customer complaint about website loading times:
1. Check server response times
2. Review database query efficiency
3. Examine client-side performance
4. Propose optimisation solutions"

Why it works: Breaks down the task into logical steps
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Transform Commands
Take this basic command:
```
Write a blog post about healthy eating.
```

Transform it into a detailed command with specific parameters.

### Exercise 2: Scenario Building

```

Expand it into a detailed scenario with specific context and requirements.

### Exercise 3: Context Enhancement

```
You are a financial advisor.
```

Add layers of specific details to create a more focused prompt.
