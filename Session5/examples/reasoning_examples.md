- Customer demographics
Provide detailed analysis for each point."

Step 2: Opportunity Identification
Prompt: "Based on the market analysis:
- Identify potential growth markets
- Analyse entry barriers
- Evaluate resource requirements
- Calculate potential ROI
Show your reasoning for each conclusion."

Step 3: Strategy Formation
Prompt: "Using the opportunities identified:

```

## 2. Self-Correction Mechanisms

### Example: Project Plan Review
```
Task: Review and improve a project implementation plan

Initial Assessment:
"Review the following project plan for completeness and effectiveness:
[Project Plan Details]

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Timeline feasibility
2. Resource allocation
3. Risk management
4. Stakeholder consideration
5. Success metrics"

Self-Correction Loop:
Step 1: Initial Review
- Identify gaps and inconsistencies
- Mark areas needing improvement
- Note unclear elements

Step 2: Improvement Suggestions
- Propose specific enhancements
- Justify each suggestion
- Consider implementation impact

Step 3: Validation
- Check against best practices
- Verify timeline feasibility
- Confirm resource availability

Step 4: Final Review
- Assess improvements
- Verify completeness
- Ensure clarity and coherence
```

## 3. Complex Problem-Solving Examples

### Example: Technical Issue Resolution
```
Task: Resolve a complex system performance issue

Structured Approach:
1. Problem Definition
Prompt: "Define the exact symptoms and impact:
- What are the specific performance issues?
- When do they occur?
- Who is affected?
- What is the business impact?"

2. Root Cause Analysis
Prompt: "Analyse potential causes:
- System logs review
- Performance metrics analysis
- User behaviour patterns
- System architecture review"

3. Solution Development
Prompt: "Based on the analysis:
- Propose potential solutions
- Evaluate each solution's impact
- Consider implementation requirements
- Assess risks and benefits"

4. Implementation Planning
Prompt: "For the chosen solution:
- Create detailed implementation steps
- Define success criteria
- Plan testing approach
- Develop rollback procedures"
```

## 4. Practice Exercises
